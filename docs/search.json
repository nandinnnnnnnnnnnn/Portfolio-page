    "text": "Problem Statement\nIn statistical computing, performance matters. When working with large datasets in Pandas and NumPy, using loops can make your code extremely slow. This becomes a serious problem when analyzing real-world data with thousands or millions of rows.\nVectorization is a powerful concept that allows operations to run much faster by applying computations to entire arrays at once instead of processing one element at a time.\nIn this blog, I will explain the difference between loops and vectorization, demonstrate both approaches, compare their speed, and share my personal experience learning this concept in my statistics and data science classes. Vectorization is a core feature of NumPy. See the official NumPy documentation on vectorization for more examples."

    "text": "My Personal Experience: When My Code Was Too Slow\nDuring my STAT 180 and STAT 386 classes, I worked with datasets like cereal nutrition data, weather data, titanic and iris datasets. At first, I wrote my code using loops because it felt natural. I was thinking step-by-step, like solving math manually.\nFor example, when calculating a new column based on two existing columns, I wrote code like this:\n# slow loop version\nfor i in range(len(df)):\n    df[\"new\"][i] = df[\"a\"][i] + df[\"b\"][i]\nIt worked. But when I ran it on larger datasets, it became very slow. Sometimes my notebook would freeze, or my Streamlit app would take too long to load. Later, I learned vectorization. This changed everything."
