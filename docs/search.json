While libraries like `sklearn` can perform regression instantly, implementing linear regression from scratch using NumPy reveals how statistical computing, linear algebra, and probability work together behind the scenes.\n\nThis tutorial explains how linear regression works computationally and statistically, and shows how NumPy can be used to compute regression coefficients directly.\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts Overview\n\nLinear regression models the relationship between a predictor variable \\(x\\) and an outcome variable \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- **\\(y\\)** = observed value  \n- **\\(\\beta_0\\)** = intercept  \n- **\\(\\beta_1\\)** = slope  \n- **\\(\\varepsilon\\)** = random noise (error)  \n\nThe goal is to estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Example Dataset\n\nSuppose we want to predict exam score based on hours studied.\n\n| hours (x) | score (y) |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| 2         | 65        |\n| 4         | 75        |\n| 6         | 85        |\n| 8         | 95        |\n\nWe want to find the best line that fits these points.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Understanding Errors and Squared Errors\n\nThe prediction from regression is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n\\]\n\nError is:\n\n\\[\nerror = y - \\hat y\n\\]\n\nSquared error is:\n\n\\[\nerror^2 = (y - \\hat y)^2\n\\]\n\nRegression finds coefficients that minimize:\n\n\\[\n\\sum (y - \\hat y)^2\n\\]\n\nThis is called minimizing the **sum of squared errors (SSE)**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Representing Data as a Matrix (Statistical Computing Step)\n\nNumPy represents data efficiently using matrices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])\ny = np.array([65, 75, 85, 95])\n\n# create design matrix\nX = np.column_stack((np.ones(len(x)), x))\n\nprint(X)\n:::"

At first, I wrote my code using loops because it felt natural. I was thinking step-by-step, like solving math manually.\nFor example, when calculating a new column based on two existing columns, I wrote code like this:\n# slow loop version\nfor i in range(len(df)):\n    df[\"new\"][i] = df[\"a\"][i] + df[\"b\"][i]\nIt worked. But when I ran it on larger datasets, it became very slow. Sometimes my notebook would freeze, or my Streamlit app would take too long to load. Later, I learned vectorization.
