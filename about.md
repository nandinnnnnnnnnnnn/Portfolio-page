## Background

My name is **Nandintsetseg Batsaikhan**, and I am an undergraduate student at **Brigham Young University** majoring in **Statistics with a Data Science emphasis**, with minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. I am interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, and building data-driven applications that solve real-world problems.

My academic work has focused on probability, statistical inference, SQL databases, and programming in Python and R. My long-term goal is to work in a data-focused role where I can combine statistics, programming, and critical thinking to support decision-making.
